Let me break down the `receiver.c` program in detail:

### Header Files and Includes
```c
#include <stdio.h>    // Standard I/O functions (printf, perror)
#include <stdlib.h>   // Standard library (exit)
#include <string.h>   // String handling functions
#include <sys/types.h> // Various data types used by system calls
#include <sys/ipc.h>  // IPC access structure
#include <sys/msg.h>  // Message queue structures and constants
#include <errno.h>    // Error handling
```

These are the same header files used in the sender program. They provide necessary functions and data structures for message queue operations.

### Message Structure Definition
```c
struct message {
    long msg_type;  // Message type (used as priority)
    char msg_text[100]; // Message content
};
```

This structure definition is **critical** - it must exactly match the structure used in the sender program. If the structures don't match (in size, field order, or types), the message data would be misinterpreted.

### Variable Declarations
```c
int main() {
    key_t key;      // Key to identify the message queue
    int msgid;      // Message queue identifier
    struct message msg; // Message structure
```

Same variables as in the sender program:
- `key_t key`: Will hold the key that identifies the message queue
- `int msgid`: Will store the message queue ID once it's obtained
- `struct message msg`: Will hold messages received from the queue

### Generating the Same Key
```c
// Generate the same key used by the sender
if ((key = ftok(".", 'A')) == -1) {
    perror("ftok error");
    exit(1);
}
```

This is crucial for IPC (Inter-Process Communication): 
- The receiver must generate the **exact same key** as the sender to access the same queue
- That's why we use the same parameters for `ftok()` - the current directory path (`"."`) and the same project identifier (`'A'`)
- If the keys don't match, the receiver would either fail to find the queue or would access a different queue

### Accessing the Existing Message Queue
```c
// Access the existing message queue
if ((msgid = msgget(key, 0666)) == -1) {
    perror("msgget error");
    exit(1);
}
```

Here, `msgget()` is used differently than in the sender:
- The sender used `IPC_CREAT` flag to create the queue if it didn't exist
- The receiver simply tries to access the existing queue, so we don't use `IPC_CREAT`
- Just provide the permissions (0666) to match those used in the sender
- If the queue doesn't exist, this will fail with an error

### Receiving Messages from the Queue
```c
// Receive and display each message from the queue
// Use 0 as msg_type to receive messages in FIFO order
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    // Receive any message (0 means any type)
    if (msgrcv(msgid, &msg, sizeof(msg.msg_text), 0, 0) == -1) {
        perror("msgrcv error");
        exit(1);
    }
    
    printf("Received message: %s (Priority: %ld)\n", msg.msg_text, msg.msg_type);
}
```

This loop receives three messages from the queue:
- `msgrcv()` is the function to receive messages:
  - First parameter: message queue ID
  - Second parameter: pointer to the message structure where data will be stored
  - Third parameter: maximum size of message to receive (just the data portion, not including `msg_type`)
  - Fourth parameter: **type of message to receive** (important!):
    - `0`: Receive the first message in the queue regardless of type (FIFO order)
    - Positive number (like 2): Receive only messages with exactly that type
    - Negative number (like -3): Receive the message with the lowest type that is less than or equal to the absolute value
  - Fifth parameter: flags (0 means default behavior - block until a message is available)
- After receiving, the program prints the message text and its priority (type)

The fourth parameter (`0` in this case) means we're receiving messages in the order they were sent (FIFO), regardless of their priority. This is why even though we sent messages with priorities 3, 1, and 2, they will be received in the order 3, 1, 2 (same sending order).

### Removing the Message Queue
```c
// Optional: Remove the message queue
if (msgctl(msgid, IPC_RMID, NULL) == -1) {
    perror("msgctl error");
    exit(1);
}
```

This is a cleanup step that removes the message queue from the system:
- `msgctl()` controls the message queue:
  - First parameter: message queue ID
  - Second parameter: command (`IPC_RMID` means remove the queue)
  - Third parameter: control structure (NULL since it's not needed for removal)
- This is important to prevent message queues from accumulating in the system
- In a real application, you'd need to decide which process is responsible for cleanup

### Key Points About the Receiver Program

1. **Message Order**: With the receiver using `msgrcv(..., 0, 0)`, it receives messages in FIFO order (the order they were sent).

2. **Priority-Based Reception**: If we wanted to receive messages based on priority (lowest type number first), we could change the fourth parameter of `msgrcv()` to a negative number like `-999` (to get all types up to 999).

3. **Selective Reception**: If we only wanted messages of a specific type, we'd set the fourth parameter to that type number.

4. **Blocking Behavior**: By default, `msgrcv()` blocks (waits) if no message is available. You can add `IPC_NOWAIT` in the flags parameter to make it non-blocking.

5. **Queue Persistence**: Message queues persist in the system until explicitly removed or until the system is restarted. That's why we have the cleanup step.
